# Description
This project is a simple Task Board Application designed for project team members to manage and organize project tasks. The app is built using HTML, CSS, and jQuery, and leverages the Day.js library to handle date functionalities. It allows users to create tasks, assign due dates, and track the progress of tasks through various states such as Not Yet Started, In Progress, and Completed. The app stores the tasks in localStorage, so they persist even after a page refresh.

## Features
- Task Management: Add, edit, and delete tasks with a title, description, and due date.
- Drag-and-Drop Functionality: Tasks can be moved between different columns representing their progress state.
- Deadline Tracking: Tasks nearing the deadline are highlighted in yellow, while overdue tasks are highlighted in red.
- Persistence: Tasks are saved in localStorage and remain visible after page refreshes.
